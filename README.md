# Blackjack-Game

In this practice, I created my first full game using html, css and javascript. The game is Blackjack, and the goal is to draw cards trying to reach the number 21. If you go over 21, you lose. If you score 21 you win. If you score less than 21, you can choose to draw more cards or call it game. 

The skills I learned and developed by building this game include: arrays, objects, booleans, if else statements, comparions operators, logical operators, for loops, the Math object, and return statements. 

I hope you enjoyed this game!
